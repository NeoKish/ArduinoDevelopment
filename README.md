This repository involves two different techniques implemented on Arduino IDE platform for calculating RPM(Revolutions per minute) of a spinning object 

RPMCounter(using Hall Effect Sensor):This calculates the RPM of a rotating object fitted with four alternating magnets 

RPMCounter(using Optical sensor):This calculates the RPM of a rotating object with a dark path on one area of the surface of the rotating object
